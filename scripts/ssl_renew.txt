# Make ssl_renew.sh executable:
chmod +x ssl_renew.sh

# Open your root crontab file to run the renewal script at a specified interval:
sudo crontab -e

At the end of the file, add the following line:
...
*/5 * * * * /home/www/ishipilov.ru/scripts/ssl_renew.sh >> /var/log/cron.log 2>&1

# This will set the job interval to every five minutes, so you can test whether your renewal request has worked as intended.
# You have also created a log file, cron.log, to record relevant output from the job.
# After five minutes, check cron.log to confirm whether the renewal request has succeeded:
tail -f /var/log/cron.log

# You can now modify the crontab file to set a daily interval.
# To run the script every day at noon, for example, you could modify the last line of the file like the following:
...
0 12 * * * /home/www/ishipilov.ru/scripts/ssl_renew.sh >> /var/log/cron.log 2>&1

# Remove or comment out the --dry-run option from your ssl_renew.sh script.
